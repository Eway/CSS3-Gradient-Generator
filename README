CSS3 Gradient Generator, created by Damian Galarza.
http://gradients.glrzad.com/

This gradient generator is intended to create a simple UI for a user to generate a CSS3 Webkit gradient allowing the user to define various colors and starting points.

This gradient generator is intended for use in a Webkit browser for full affect to see the sample gradient. Though you can still visit the page in Firefox or IE and generate a webkit gradient, without seeing a live sample.

Color selector is provided by the ColorSelector jQuery plugin available from:

TODO:
- Add radial gradient support
- Allow user selection for the direction of the gradient (i.e. left top to left bottom etc)
